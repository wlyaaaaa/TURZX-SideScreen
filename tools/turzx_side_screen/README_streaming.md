# TURZX Side Screen Streaming Investigation

Scope: static/reflection investigation for the 480x1920 side screen refresh path. This document intentionally does not define an unverified differential protocol.

Safety constraints used during this investigation:

- No Drive upload.
- No COM7 send, no serial open/write from the new inspection script.
- No changes to `metrics_agent` or renderer files.
- New investigation artifact: `tools\turzx_side_screen\InspectTurzxProtocol.ps1`.

## Current Streaming Path

The active video stream path is full-frame only:

1. `StartVideoStream.ps1` builds and runs `TURZX.SideScreen.Stream.exe`.
2. `TURZX.SideScreen.Stream.cs` renders a 480x1920 bitmap for each loop.
3. `TURZX.SideScreen.TurzxHelperSender.SendBitmap(...)` loads `TURZX.weatherfix.metrics.exe` when present, otherwise `TURZX.exe`.
4. Reflection calls `趵.蛳(Bitmap, 4, 480)` to produce frame data.
5. Reflection creates `駟(devCode)`, opens the `釃` serial helper field `韘`, and calls `駟.詔(byte[], int, false)`.
6. The observed helper message is `OK frameBytes=3686400`.

The full frame size is:

```text
480 * 1920 * 4 = 3,686,400 bytes
```

## Reflection Findings

`TURZX.weatherfix.metrics.exe` exposes these relevant obfuscated types:

- `趵`: bitmap/frame conversion helpers. The helper path uses `蛳(Bitmap, int, int) -> byte[]`.
- `駟`: serial/display driver. Relevant methods include:
  - `詔(byte[], int, bool) -> void`: full-frame send path.
  - `裺(byte[], byte[], long, bool) -> int`: suspected differential path.
  - field `韘: 釃`: serial helper.
- `釃`: RJCP serial wrapper and packet writer. Relevant methods include:
  - `詔(string) -> bool`: open a port.
  - `込() -> void`: close.
  - `詔(int, int, byte[], byte) -> void`: command packet writer.
  - `詔(byte[], int) -> void`: frame/body writer.
- `陾`: USB/207LCD path. It has `豛(byte[], bool) -> bool` and LibUsb fields, but this is not the current COM streaming path.
- `뛮`: base driver class with the same broad send/diff method surface.

`TURZX.exe` can enumerate the same key runtime types via normal reflection. Raw Cecil metadata for `TURZX.exe` shows only a protected-looking `x1400.*` outer layout, so readable IL evidence below is taken from `TURZX.weatherfix.metrics.exe`. Treat the patched executable as the practical reflection target used by the current helper.

## Command Evidence

Readable IL in `TURZX.weatherfix.metrics.exe` shows:

- `駟.詔(byte[], int, bool)` sends command `200` when the alternate-frame flag is false, or command `202` when it is true, then writes the body bytes.
- `釃.詔(int command, int declaredLength, byte[] payload, byte extra)` builds a 250-byte command packet:
  - byte `0`: command.
  - bytes `1..2`: magic `0xEF 0x69` (`61289`).
  - bytes `3..6`: declared length, big-endian.
  - byte `7`: extra.
  - bytes `10..`: optional payload.
- `釃.詔(byte[], int)` writes body data as repeated 250-byte serial writes with a 249-byte payload budget and sleeps 1 ms around each 24,900 payload bytes.
- `駟.裺(byte[], byte[], long, bool)` contains a command `204` send:
  - It calls proprietary frame-delta helpers on `趵` with a `65000` threshold.
  - It writes command `204` through `釃.詔(204, length, payload, 0)`.
  - It also manipulates sequence/length bytes and the `0xEF69` marker, but the exact payload layout is not reliably reconstructable from static IL alone.

Conclusion: command `204` exists, but this investigation did not find reliable evidence for a safe public payload contract. There is no confirmed rectangle/dirty-region API, no verified local-region command, and no verified serial compression/video-stream command for this side-screen path. Do not invent a differential protocol from the name or constant alone.

## Measured Throughput

Existing local log evidence from `tools\turzx_side_screen\out\video-stream.log`:

```text
samples=93
frameBytes=3686400
min=2328ms
max=2391ms
avg=2351.4ms
```

The default stream interval is `3000ms`, but sending one full frame already consumes about `2.35s`. That leaves only about `0.65s` idle time per 3-second loop.

At the measured average:

```text
3,686,400 bytes / 2.351s = about 1.57 MB/s payload
```

A 0.5-second full-frame animation target would require:

```text
3,686,400 bytes / 0.5s = about 7.37 MB/s payload
```

That is roughly 4.7x the observed payload rate, before accounting for 250-byte packet overhead, 1 ms periodic sleeps, serial open/close overhead, and device-side consume time. Therefore the current full-screen refresh path cannot support smooth 0.5-second animation.

## Strategy

v1:

- Keep the device path full-screen and low-frequency.
- Treat `3000ms` as a realistic default for stable display.
- Avoid UI animations that depend on sub-second device refresh.
- Coalesce metric changes and skip sends when rendered content is materially unchanged.

v1.1:

- Add an application-level card dirty API above the renderer/sender boundary.
- Track dirty cards/rectangles in memory, but keep the wire format as verified full-frame until command `204` is captured and validated.
- Use dirty state to reduce render work, coalesce frequent metric changes, and prepare a clean future adapter for differential sending.
- Keep a minimum send interval and avoid per-card animation promises unless a real differential path is proven.

Future validation path:

- Capture official vendor traffic for controlled one-card or small-region changes.
- Compare captured `204` packets against `駟.裺(...)` static evidence.
- Validate on hardware only after the payload layout is understood.
- Only then implement a differential sender behind a feature flag with full-frame fallback.

## Inspection Command

Run the static/reflection inspection without opening COM ports:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\turzx_side_screen\InspectTurzxProtocol.ps1
```

The script prints reflection summaries, constant hits, and key IL windows. It does not instantiate `駟`, does not call `釃.詔(string)`, and does not write serial data.
