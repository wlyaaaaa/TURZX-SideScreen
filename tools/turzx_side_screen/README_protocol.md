# TURZX side screen protocol notes

Scope: v1 reusable protocol layer for the 480x1920 TURZX side screen.

Verified from `tools\turzx_protocol_probe\TurzxProtocolProbe.cs` and local black-box converter samples:

- Full frame size: `480 * 1920 * 4 = 3686400` bytes.
- Device pixel order: row-major `B, G, R, A`.
- Full-frame send default used by the successful probe path:
  - Send one 250-byte command packet with command `200`.
  - Command packet bytes:
    - `[0]`: command.
    - `[1..2]`: magic `EF 69`.
    - `[3..6]`: declared payload length, big-endian.
    - `[7]`: extra byte.
    - `[8..9]`: reserved zero.
    - `[10..]`: optional command payload, max 240 bytes.
  - Then write raw frame bytes in chunks of up to `24900` bytes.
- Alternate full-frame command `202` exists in the vendor driver path, but v1 defaults to command `200`.
- `RJCP.SerialPortStream` is required for COM open/write. The ordinary `.NET SerialPort` probe path timed out.

Not implemented in v1:

- Command `204` differential/partial refresh. The vendor assembly contains a `204` path, but `TurzxProtocolProbe.cs` did not verify its payload layout against the device. `WriteDifferentialFrame` intentionally throws `NotSupportedException` until that protocol is captured and tested.

Safe test command:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\turzx_side_screen\TestProtocolEncoding.ps1
```

The test compiles and runs pure logic only; it does not open `COM7` or any serial port.
